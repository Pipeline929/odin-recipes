    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This recipe makes for hearty breakfast burritos that are intended to be made in a large batch so that individual burritos can be frozen and reheated as needed. Making these in advance and freezing is a big time-saver for busy mornings.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package of bacon</li>
        <li>10 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of milk</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 cups of frozen hash brown potatoes with peppers and onions (such as Ore-ida potatoes O'Brien)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>10 large flour tortillas</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup of salsa, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels and crumble into bits. Keep skillet warm.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs, milk, and salt together in a bowl. Pour into the hot skillet. Cok and stir over medium-high heat until eggs are set, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in same skillet over medium-high heat. Add frozen potatoes, garlic salt, and pepper. Fry until browned on the bottom, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook until other side is browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Let cool.</li>
        <li>Cut 10 squares of aluminum foil slightly larger than the tortillas. Lay 1 tortilla on each square; evenly distribute cheddar cheese on top. Add eggs, bacon, salsa, and potatoes to each tortilla, in that order. Tightly roll the burritos, tucking tops and bottoms in first.</li>
        <li>Wrap aluminum foil tightly around each burrito, covering it completely. Place in resealable plastic bags in a single layer. Remove as much air as possible form the bags before sealing. Store in the freezer until ready to reheat.</li>
        <li>Reheat by removing the aluminum foil, placing the burrito on a microwave-safe plate, and topping it with a paper towel. Heat in the microwave until evenly warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
